## Deep Reinforcement Learning in Algorithm Trading 

### [Project Paper]

The financial industry has evolved dramatically over the lastdecades and continues to face more and more challenges amidrapidly increased   competitions,   technologies   developmentsand  complex  political  and  economic  environments.  To  facethese  challenges, how  to  apply  Machine  Learning  methodsto  develop  the  profitable  winning  strategies  in  the  algorithmstock  trading  and  portfolio management,  framed  in  termsof  risk-factor  exposure,  dynamic  environment,  as  opposedto  asset  classes,  is  becoming  a  more  important problem.The  success  of  Deep  Learning  has  achieved  a  lot  of  stateof  the  art  performances  in  many  industries,  from  computervision,natural  language  processing  to  autonomous  drivingand  robotics  application.  At  the  same  time,  reinforcementlearning  also  has  gained  a lot  of  attention  from  academiccommunities  to  various  industries,  combined  with  the  tech-niques  from  deep  learning,  Deep  Reinforcement Learninghave created an intelligent agent to interact with an unknowndynamic  environment  and  aimed  to  maximize  its  cumulativerewards.  By  using the  methods  from  deep  learning,  DeepReinforcement  Learning  is  learning  through  trial  and  errorfrom  simultaneously  sequential  and  evaluative feedback  andsampled by nonlinear function approximation. Based on thesecharacteristics,  Deep  Reinforcement  Learning  is  a  promisingapproach in algorithm trading and portfolio management.
